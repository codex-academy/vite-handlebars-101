# HTML  frameworks

HTML frameworks makes it easier for you to create beautifull HTML pages.

To use them you:

* need to reference the CSS files from the framework,
* use the HTML elements as required by the framework.
* and add the CSS classNames to the elements.

[SimpleGrid](https://simplegrid.io/) is a small framwework mainly focussing on responsive layouts. [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) and [Materialize](https://materializecss.com/) are complete HTML frameworks that gives you responsive layout support & various HTML components and more.

Note that both [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/layout/grid/) and [Materialize](https://materializecss.com/grid.html) has grid support for layouts. Both use HTML container elements extensively to support HTML layouts.

The best way to learn these frameworks is to use their extensive document pages and then to try the examples out.
